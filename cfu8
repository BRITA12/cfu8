'''GrubHub Program - First ask the user if they ordered delivery

Version 1
If the user responds “yes” - say great!If the user responds with anything else say: “NO?! So who is cooking?”
Version 2 - Builds on ver1If the user responds “yes….
- Ask the user the cost of the food ordered
-Ask the user how many people are splitting the order
- Calculate and print out the cost per person
Ex: “The cost per person is $2.50'''


ordered_delivery = input("Did you order delivery? (yes/no): ")
if ordered_delivery == "yes":
    print("Great!")
    cost_of_food = float(input("Enter the cost of the food ordered: $"))
    people_splitting = int(input("How many people are splitting the order? "))
     if people_splitting > 0:
        cost_per_person = cost_of_food / people_splitting
        print(f"The cost per person is ${cost_per_person:.2f}")
    else:
        print("Number of people must be at least 1.")
else:
    print("NO?! So who is cooking?")
